1. We create four functions

add() → adds two numbers.

subtract() → subtracts the second number from the first.

multiply() → multiplies two numbers.

divide() → divides the first number by the second.



2. Show a simple menu

The program shows options like this:

1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide



3. Take input from the user

The user chooses a number (1–4) to pick an operation.

Then the user types two numbers for calculation.



4. Do the calculation

If the user picked 1 → the program adds.

If 2 → it subtracts.

If 3 → it multiplies.

If 4 → it divides.

Finally, the program shows the answer.



5. Handle wrong choices

If the user types something other than 1–4, it shows:

Invalid input
